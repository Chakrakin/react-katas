## TTD - Tic Tac Toe Game

There are 30 failing tests in this training example 
<br />which you should make successful via implementation of the requirements

You are allowed to add more tests if you need them, but not modify existing ones _(there's one exclusion, see below)_

During implementation, feel free to comment out tests you are not working on, 
<br />but at the end, not a single test should be disabled

### Exclusion
The tests assume that the gamefield consists of strings with 'X', 'O' and '_'.
<br />If you want to change this: The tests need to be adapted
<br />_reach out to me if you want to do that or send me a pull-request_ 

## What for?
This scenario should give you an opportunity to try the "Test-first" approach with a given set of tests and experience
<br />on your own how TDD can support you in your daily work.
<br />During implementation your code will evolve, and you will have to refactor/reimplement elements during the process.

One important benefit of TDD is: Once your tests are successful, you can rely on tests during refactoring and make sure 
<br />everything is working after changes are made

## Sidenote

Because of limited time (1,5h) it is likely that implementation won't get finished.
<br />Feel free to train on this example and post me (Kurt) your solution if you want to evaluate on this 

A possible solution will be posted after the workshop to this repo in a seperate branch
